    "Note:\n",
    "This script demonstrates the implementation of a simple Speech-to-Text system using the SpeechRecognition library. It utilizes Google’s Speech-to-Text API to transcribe audio data from a .wav file into text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Library Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "SpeechRecognition: A Python library that provides tools for speech recognition using various APIs and engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "The input must be a valid .wav audio file. Ensure the file path is correctly specified and the audio file is accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps in the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize the Recognizer object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load and process the audio file using AudioFile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the recognize_google method to transcribe the audio into text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Does not require downloading or setting up pre-trained models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick and lightweight, suitable for small transcription tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requires an active internet connection as it relies on Google’s API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "The script includes error handling to catch and display any issues during processing or transcription.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace the audio_file path with the path to your .wav file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the script to get the transcribed text output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deliverable:\n",
    "The script outputs the transcription of the input audio file or an error message if the process fails.\n",
    "\n"
